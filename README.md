# Ops Toolshed Chrome Extension 🛠️

**Current version: 1.9** • Built for Media Operations & Planning teams

Ops Toolshed is a Google Chrome extension that supercharges Mediaocean Prisma and streamlines day-to-day campaign workflows. It automates repetitive tasks, adds one-click navigation and exports, flags budget and product code issues, provides quick access to approvers and standard operating procedures, and centralises agency tools.

## What's new in 1.9
- **Campaign Approval Tracking:** Monitors submitted campaigns in the background every 5 minutes, notifies users with an in-page toast alert when marked as Approved, displays an `x/y Campaign Approved` status notice with dropdown list next to Switch Accounts, and enables one-click navigation to open approved campaigns in a new tab.
- **Campaign History:** Adds global search for visited campaigns by name, client, CP number, CL/PR/CA reference, or supplier with local logging and paginated browsing.

## 🚀 How to Install (Quick 2-Minute Setup)

Because Ops Toolshed is an internal tool, it is installed directly into Google Chrome using **Developer mode**.

### Step 1: Download & Extract the Files
1. Download the latest release ZIP (e.g. from your team's SharePoint, Teams channel, or GitHub releases).
2. Extract the ZIP into a **permanent folder** on your computer. 
   - **Recommended location:** Inside your **Documents** folder, create a new folder called **Chrome Extensions** (for example: `Documents\Chrome Extensions\Ops-Toolshed`).
   > ⚠️ **Important:** Do not leave the files in your temporary `Downloads` folder or delete/move the folder after installing. Chrome runs the extension directly from this location whenever you use the browser.

### Step 2: Open Chrome Extensions
1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Type or paste the following into your address bar and press **Enter**:
   ```text
   chrome://extensions
   ```
   *(Alternatively: Click the Chrome **three-dots menu (⋮)** in the top-right corner > **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions**).*

### Step 3: Enable Developer Mode
1. In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, turn on the **Developer mode** toggle switch.

### Step 4: Load the Extension
1. Click the **Load unpacked** button in the top-left corner.
2. Browse to and select your extracted `Ops-Toolshed` folder (select the folder that contains `manifest.json`).
3. You will immediately see **Ops Toolshed** appear in your list of active extensions!

### Step 5: Pin the Extension for Easy Access
By default, newly loaded extensions may be hidden inside Chrome's menus. To make it easily accessible:
1. Click the **Extensions** menu icon (the puzzle piece 🧩) to the right of your address bar.
   - *If you don't see the puzzle piece icon, click Chrome's **three-dots menu (⋮)** in the top-right corner and hover over **Extensions**.*
2. In the dropdown list, find **Ops Toolshed 🛠️**.
3. Click the **Pin** icon (📌) next to it so it stays pinned to your Chrome toolbar for one-click access.

### 🔄 How to Update to a New Version
When an update is released:
1. Download the new version and replace the files inside your existing `Documents\Chrome Extensions\Ops-Toolshed` folder.
2. Go back to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.
3. Find **Ops Toolshed** and click the **Reload** button (🔄 circular arrow).

### ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQs
- **"Manifest file is missing or unreadable" error?**
  When clicking *Load unpacked*, ensure you select the specific folder that directly contains `manifest.json`, rather than a nested outer or unzipped wrapper folder.
- **Is this safe to use with client data?**
  Yes. Ops Toolshed executes entirely within your local browser. No passwords, client names, campaign budgets, or user tracking data are ever transmitted to third-party or external servers.
